    <h1 class="display-4">Research Statement</h1>

    <div class="para">My previous research primarily centered on Large Language Models (LLMs) and computational modeling. In the first aspect, I evaluated the content generated by AI-powered chatbots and LLMs using linguistic metrics drawn from theories of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Additionally, I engineered robust machine learning detectors, trained on linguistic features such as part-of-speech entropy and CFG frequency distribution, to identify Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). In the second aspect, I developed computational models that demonstrate human sentence processing. Using the vectoral parser, I simulated the increased parsing challenges encountered in sentences with local ambiguity. Furthermore, I illustrated the parallel propagation of ambiguity during the reading process with the model.</div>

    <div class="para">These two branches converges into my current interest. Given the nature of pragmatics, the absence of a systematic, well-established rule system has significantly hindered its acquisition among LLMs. Nonetheless, as human beings, we can naturally develop the ability to understand and generate implicatures simply by participating in society. I'm eager to investigate the principles governing the human acquisition of pragmatics and translating them into a computational model. By achieving this, we can provide therapy plan for people with impairments in this aspect, facilitating their reintegration into society and improving their overall social adaptability. On the flip side, we can come up with a solution to enhance LLMs' pragmatic skills, adding a valuable dimension to their communication abilities.</div>
