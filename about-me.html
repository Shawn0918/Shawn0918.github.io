    <h1 class="display-4">Research Statement</h1>

    <div class="para">My previous research mainly focused on the computational modeling and natural language processing. I evaluated the content generated by large language model(LLM) with linguistic theories with respect to syntax, semantics and pragmatics and designed detectors to distinguish it from human language. I also wrote scripts to investigate people's sentence processing by conducting regression analysis with eye-tracking data from existing corpora.</div>

    <div class="para">I'm currently researching large language models' comprehension of implicatures. Implicature is a pragmatic term that indicates the case when an extra meaning is implied indirectly by the surface expression, usually connotated by the context. It features complex ideas involved in a simpler expression or overtly counterfactual sentences to attain certain effects, such as humor. Regarded as a mastery of language, the implicatures are vastly believed to be introduced through violating the cooperative principles in discourse that people normally would comply with for effective communication. To precisely decode and encode them entails pragmatic principles inherent in human mind, and to notice the situation when their usage is felicitous requires the familiarity with different social contexts. Given the difficulty in acquisition, I'm intrigued by the question that to what extent does the state-of-the-art language models are able to understand implicatures. By evaluating their pragmatic understanding with different context I'm expecting to find their deficiency, and thus to improve them into more versed communicators. Besides, understanding how artificial intelligence acquires such capability gives insights in human's acquisition of complex pragmatic skills, and serves to unveil the nature of communication. </div>
