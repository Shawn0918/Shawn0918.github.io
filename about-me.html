    <h1 class="display-4">Research Statement</h1>
    <div class="para"><b>My future goal:</b> I want to dive deeper into the intersection of linguistics, cognitive science, and computer science, exploring whether the theoretical frameworks proposed by linguistic theories truly manifest in language processing and how this cognitive process can be formalized at the algorithmic level. I want to employ machine learning, experimental methods and cognitive modeling to approach these problems. I'm excited about investigating state-of-the-art LLMs and developing psychologically plausible models to better understand human language processing. </div>  

    <div class="para"><b>A summary of my previous research:</b> My previous research focused on large language models (LLMs) and human sentence processing. In my first line of research, I developed machine learning detectors to distinguish the exam essays generated by LLMs from those written by human test takers. I also evaluated the ability of LLMs to understand conversational implicatures with a hand-crafted conversational dataset. In my second line of research, I explored the reason for the inverse correlation between the size, the amount of training data of the LLMs, and their prediction of surprisal. I also modified a computational cognitive model, a left corner parser with distributed associative memory, to evaluate the surprisal account of sentence processing difficulty. The refactored model reveals the activation of memory at the neurological level and the parallel propagation of various analyses with computationally formalized mental states.</div>

    <div class="para"><b>What motivated me to study computational linguistics:</b> My interest in computational linguistics stemmed from my broad interest in linguistic phenomena and theories. Before my undergraduate study, I learned English, Spanish, and Japanese and this experience motivated me to think about the universality across languages. In my freshman year, I was intrigued by syntax that transforms the richness of language into a computable representation consisting of discrete and combinatory units. My interest grew along with my access to syntactic phenomena such as filler-gap constructions, constituent movements, and garden-path sentences around the question of how they are processed by humans. I was also interested in pragmatic principles, especially how people understand implicatures in daily communication. With the technological breakthroughs in conversational agents and experimental methods, I was interested in examining these linguistic theories with empirical evidence, and thus embarked on a journey of computational linguistics.</div>
