    <h1 class="display-4">Research Statement</h1>
    <div class="para">My interest in computational linguistics stemmed from my broad interest in linguistic phenomena and theories. Before I attended college, my learning experience of multiple languages triggered my curiosity about the universality across languages, which led me to the study of linguistics. In my freshman year, I was intrigued by the tree diagrams of sentences, which convert the richness of language into a computable representation consisting of discrete and combinatory units. In my later study, I developed an interest in syntactic phenomena such as filler-gap constructions, constituent movements, and garden-path sentences and was curious about how they are processed by humans. I was also interested in semantic and pragmatic disambiguation, especially how people understand implicatures in daily communication. My access to generative grammar and the cooperative principle allowed me to examine these phenomena through a theoretical lens. However, I found myself unable to be totally convinced by these theories without data-driven evidence. Cross-linguistic evidence is persuasive though, data is the best storyteller from my perspective. The truthfulness of theories, in my view, hinges on their statistical significance derived from real-world data. To validate the existence of frameworks or cognitive processes posited by linguistic theories, I embarked on a journey into computational linguistics. </div>

    <div class="para">In my previous research, I evaluated the linguistic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) and probed into surprisal through corpora data and a computational cognitive model. In the first part, I analyzed the content generated by AI-powered chatbots and LLMs using linguistic metrics drawn from theories of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. I also developed machine learning detectors, which are trained on linguistic features such as part-of-speech entropy and CFG frequency distribution, to identify exam essays generated by LLMs. In the second part, I explored the reason for the inverse correlation between the size of LLMs and their prediction of surprisal using naturalistic data from self-paced reading and eye-tracking corpora. I also investigated the derivation of surprisal with a computational cognitive model implemented on distributed associative memory. By manipulating the hand-crafted grammar of two garden-path sentences, I proved the correlation between surprisal and predictability as well as the parallel propagation of analyses during parsing.</div>
      
    <div class="para">My current interest evolved from the fusion of the two areas of my work, along with my interests in theoretical linguistics. It lies in the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and cognitive science. On the one hand, I'm excited about the linguistic insights brought by language models. Developed originally by statistical models, and now most commonly through deep neural networks, language models acquire language capacity from massive training with natural human languages. I'm interested in to what extent these data-driven machines reveal patterns conforming to linguistic theories boiled down from human languages. In turn, I'm also eager to explore methods to inject linguistic constraints in humans into LLMs to improve their language competence. On the other hand, I want to dive deeper into human sentence processing, specifically to build computational cognitive models that translate linguistic theories into a computational level. I'm excited to investigate to what extent these models and therefore the theories behind them explain naturalistic data collected from empirical studies. To sum up, I'm motivated to combine my theoretical understanding with empirical and computational exploration, bridging the gap between abstract theories and tangible real-world evidence.</div>
