    <h1 class="display-4">Research Statement</h1>

    <div class="para">My previous research mainly focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and computational modeling. For the former part, I evaluated the content generated by AI-powered chatbots and LLMs with linguistic metrics derived from theories of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. I also developed machine learning detectors to identify Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). For the latter part, I developed computational models that demonstrate human sentence processing. By simulating and explaining linguistic phenomena such as the increased parsing failures in processing center-embedding and ambiguous sentences, I proved the robustness of the model.</div>

    <div class="para">As the primary catalyst of an underway revolution in productivity, today most LLMs are largely deficient in making pragmatic inference, which might be attributed to the nature of pragmatics, the lack of a well-established rule system as seen in syntax. This trait largely prevents Artificial Intelligence (AI) from becoming an eligible communicator. On the other hand, based on theories in linguistics and cognitive science summarized from field studies with human data, computational modeling focuses on developing rule-based models that simulate human processing. By verifying them on linguistic phenomena, we can prove their correctness and meanwhile, obtain a probable rule system that might be transferred to the development of AIâ€™s pragmatic skills as a robust algorithm. I aim to fulfill this dedication in my future research, providing a solution for today's LLM development.</div>
