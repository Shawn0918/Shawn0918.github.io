        <div class="para">My research interests lie in language processing among people and artificial intelligence. In my previous work, I evaluated some existing language model's linguistic capacities in terms of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. I also implemented code to investigate people's sentence processing by doing regressions on the data in eye-tracking corpora.</div>

        <div class="para">I’m especially curious about their comprehension of implicatures, a pragmatic term to indicate the case when an extra meaning is implied indirectly by the surface expression, usually connotated by the context. It features complex ideas involved in a simpler expression or overtly counterfactual sentences to attain certain effects, such as humor. Regarded as a mastery of language, the implicatures are vastly believed to be introduced through violating the cooperative principles in discourse that people normally would comply with for effective communication. To precisely decode and encode them entails the principles imprinted in one’s mind, and to notice the situation when their usage is felicitous is difficult. However, research found that large language models which are trained on huge amount of data and human’s feedback, are equipped with a certain level of implicatures decoding ability. By evaluating their pragmatic understanding with different context I’m expecting to find their deficiency, and thus to improve them into more versed communicators. Besides, understanding how artificial intelligence acquires such capability gives insights in human’s acquisition of complex pragmatic skills, and serves to unveil the nature of communication. </div>
