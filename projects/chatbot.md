title: "Evaluating Chatbots from Linguistic Perspectives"
date: 2021
published: true
summary: "I collected the discourse of AI chatbot and performed linguistic analysis. This was my first attempt in conducting a research and writing an academic paper. Although it wasn't fruitful from my current perspective, it indeed improved my abilities in reviewing previous literature, designing experiments and collaborating on a paper."
