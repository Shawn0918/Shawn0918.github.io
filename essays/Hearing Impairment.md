Hearing impairment is diagnosed when a person’s hearing thresholds are above 20 db HL. Infants receive Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS) on the first day after birth. Empirical studies show that post-neonatal screening is also indispensable, which has already been implemented in some countries. Once children fail in the screening, they should immediately receive a full screening conducted by audiologists after which appropriate treatment can be prescribed. An educational approach includes the language to acquire and the technology to use, which will influence children’s communication way and thereby their whole life. Whatever approach children adopt, in order to develop mature language and communication abilities, a large amount of language input is essential.
