How written words are encoded and decoded by the human brain? To pursue an answer to this question, we review on research in sentence processing and left corner parsing theories. We particularize the models and results in five studies that propose a left corner parser and conduct simulations with hand-crafted sentences or data from large-scale corpora. The high accuracy in simulations demonstrates both the theoretical and neurological significance of left corner parsing. Moreover, we discuss the inaccurate predictions of left corner parsing as a single predictor and the necessity of combining it with expectation-based theories.
