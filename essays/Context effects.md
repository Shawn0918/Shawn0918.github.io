Context is essential for language comprehension. When we read sentences, context offers information about word meaning, part of speech and its representation in the world. Context has the effect of facilitating our recognition of words whose meaning is congruous with their preceding context. It has been classified according to the two stages of lexical processing, namely the context effect on access and the context effect on integration. The effects context exerts on these two stages have been proved by empirical studies. Researching on context effect helps us better understand the language comprehension system. Specifically, it provides evidence for whether the language processing system is modular or interactive.
