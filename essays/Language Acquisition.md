The ultimate attainment of the L2 possesses broad significance in both language pedagogy, human cognition and neuroscience and draws fierce debate in the academic circle. The Critical Period Hypothesis(CPH) argues that such a key period for learning L1 is also compatible with L2 learning. Though with great support in neurolinguistics, the CPH is questionable from many aspects and might overgeneralize the causality of age in SLA. This article organizes a range of research and examines the CPH in detail.
